# AiGen: AI Implementation Use Cases for Developers

## Overview
AiGen is an open-source project designed to streamline the process of developing AI applications. It offers a collection of pre-configured templates for various AI use cases, allowing developers to quickly set up and deploy AI-powered apps.

## Goals and Objectives
- **Ease of Use**: Simplify the process of creating AI applications by providing ready-to-use templates that reduce setup time and complexity.
- **Flexibility**: Allow developers to choose from a variety of use cases and LLMs, catering to different project needs and preferences.
- **Extensibility**: Enable developers to extend and customize the provided templates to suit their specific requirements.
- **Community-Driven Development**: Foster a community of developers who can contribute new use cases, improvements, and features to the project.

## Key Features
1. **Pre-Configured Templates**:
    - Templates for various AI applications such as SQL chat apps, PDF chat apps, web browser apps, and more.
    - Each template includes necessary dependencies, a basic Streamlit app, and boilerplate code to get started.

2. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**:
    - Easy-to-use CLI to create new projects based on selected use cases.
    - Commands to list available use cases, create new projects, and manage configurations.

3. **Flexible LLM Integration**:
    - Support for multiple language models (LLMs).
    - Simple configuration to input API keys and select the desired LLM.

4. **Automated Setup**:
    - Automatic generation of project structure and dependencies.
    - Streamlined process to set up and run the application with minimal manual intervention.

## How It Works
1. **Installation**:
    - Install AiGen via PyPI using:
      ```bash
      pip install aigen
      ```

2. **Creating a New Project**:
    - Use the CLI to create a new project:
      ```bash
      aigen create <use_case> <project_name>
      ```
      Example:
      ```bash
      aigen create sql_chat_app my_sql_chat_project
      ```

3. **Configuring the Project**:
    - Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    - Input your API key and select your LLM in the configuration file.

4. **Running the Application**:
    - Run the application using Streamlit:
      ```bash
      streamlit run main.py
      ```

5. **Customization**:
    - Modify the generated code and configurations to tailor the application to your specific needs.

## Use Cases
1. **SQL Chat App**:
    A conversational AI app that can interact with SQL databases and execute queries based on natural language input.

2. **PDF Chat App**:
    An AI-powered application that allows users to interact with PDF documents, extracting information and answering questions based on the content.

3. **Web Browser App**:
    An AI assistant that can browse the web, fetch information, and perform actions based on user queries.

4. **Additional Use Cases**:
    Continuously expanding list of templates based on community contributions and emerging AI technologies.

## Contribution Guidelines
1. **Submitting Issues**:
    - Report bugs and request features via the GitHub issues page.
2. **Creating Pull Requests**:
    - Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request for review.
3. **Writing Documentation**:
